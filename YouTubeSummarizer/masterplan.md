# Masterplan: Recruiter‑Focused Portfolio Landing Page

This blueprint is a simple, high‑level plan (no tech stack decisions) for a clean, minimal landing page that spotlights a single project with measurable impact.

---

## Overview & Objective
- Present yourself clearly as a Frontend Developer who turns complex UX into fast, accessible interfaces.
- Lead with an impact‑first case study: YouTubeSummarizer.
- Primary action for recruiters: Visit the GitHub repo.

Core message: "Frontend Developer who turns complex UX into fast, accessible interfaces."

---

## Audience Snapshot (Recruiters)
- Skim quickly for fit, clarity, and impact.
- Want proof of problem‑solving, communication, and practical results.
- Prefer a single standout example over many shallow items.

---

## Essential Sections & Content Outline

1) Hero
- One‑line value statement (your core message).
- Short subtext that frames the project outcome.
- Primary CTA: "View GitHub Repo" (links to `https://github.com/mahimagupta13/GenAIProjects`).
- Optional small bullet list (2–3 quick strengths): lead with “Complex UX simplification.”

Copy prompts:
- Heading: "Frontend Developer simplifying complex UX into fast, accessible interfaces."
- Subtext: "Featured: YouTubeSummarizer — from 2 to 5 key insights per video."
- Button: "View the Repo"

2) Impact Highlight (above the fold or just below hero)
- One headline metric: "From 2 to 5 key insights per video."
- One sentence of context: who benefits and why it matters.

Copy prompts:
- Headline: "Clarity up: 2 → 5 key insights per video."
- Context: "Faster comprehension for users reviewing technical or long‑form content."

3) Featured Case Study: YouTubeSummarizer (Impact‑first story)
- Impact (lead): Restate the result and why it matters.
- Context: What problem users had before.
- How it works (3 concise steps): Input → Summarize → Extract insights.
- My role: Frontend design and UX simplification, accessibility considerations.
- Decisions that mattered: simplify complex flows, emphasize scannable insights, keep interactions lightweight.
- Outcome details: Example scenarios where insights improved clarity.

Copy prompts:
- Impact: "Users surfaced 5 actionable takeaways vs 2 before, improving review quality."
- Context: "Long videos buried key points; users struggled to extract what mattered."
- How it works: "Paste link → Summarize → Read 5 key insights."
- My role: "Led UX design, refined visuals for clarity, ensured accessible interaction patterns."

4) About (short, recruiter‑friendly)
- One sentence about who you are and what you do best.
- One sentence on how you work (e.g., clarity, iteration, collaboration).

Copy prompts:
- "I design and build interfaces that make complex tasks feel simple."
- "I prioritize clarity, accessible patterns, and small iterations that add up."

5) Skills Focus (conceptual, not tools)
- UX simplification, accessible patterns, clear information hierarchy, thoughtful micro‑interactions.
- Communication and documentation via concise case studies.

6) Call to Action
- Primary: "Visit GitHub Repo" (same link as hero).
- Secondary (optional): "Contact me" (email link).

7) Contact
- Simple email link and minimal social (optional). Keep it clean.

## Color & Typography Guidelines (Clean / Minimal)
- Palette: high‑contrast grayscale with a single blue accent.
  - Background: white or off‑white
  - Text: near‑black for body, true black for headings
  - Accent: restrained blue for links and primary CTA
- Use ample whitespace and clear spacing scale (e.g., XS/S/M/L/XL steps).
- Type system: one strong sans‑serif family; use 2 sizes in hero (display + body), 2–3 sizes elsewhere (H2, H3, body). Keep weights simple (bold for headings, regular for body). Avoid all‑caps except small labels.

- Optional small diagram: simple 3‑step flow (Input → Summarize → Insights) using icons or minimalist shapes.
- Headshot (optional) — neutral background, simple crop.
- Plain SVG or PNG for a simple logo mark (optional), or just use your name as text.

  - Hero heading + subtext + CTA label
  - Impact headline + one‑sentence context
  - Case study: 3 short paragraphs (Context, Approach, Impact)
  - About paragraph (2 sentences)
  - Skills bullets (3–5 items)

## Content Creation Needs (What to write)

---

## Responsiveness & Accessibility Basics (Conceptual)
- Mobile‑first layout; keep content readable at small sizes.
- Sufficient color contrast for text and CTA.
- Keyboard‑navigable focus order that mirrors the reading order.
- Clear, descriptive link labels (e.g., "View the Repo" rather than "Click here").
- Images with meaningful alt text (e.g., "Screenshot of 5 insights generated for a video").

---

## Platform / Builder Preference (Conceptual, Flexible)
- Single‑page layout with modular sections that can be assembled in any builder.
- Prioritize content clarity over effects; keep interactions subtle.
- Keep copy and visuals easy to update.

---

## Possible Future Enhancements
- Add a brief second case study (e.g., QuestionAnswer) to show breadth.
- Include 1–2 testimonials or short quotes from users/peers.
- Add a short "Process" section with a simple 3‑step diagram.
- Optional dark mode variant that preserves clarity and contrast.
- Light blog/notes area for short write‑ups.
